A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "Data collected in 1978 could be useful if combined with all data from 1978 to present. Modelling inflation is important since it affects the prices of the houses. The features are insufficient because there are several other factors that attract or repel potential homeowners and also affect the prices. Yes, factors like pool, plot area, etc must be factored in to increase the accuracy of the predictions. No, the model is not robust enough to make consitent predictions due to lack of important features in the data. Data collected in urban cities will be trivial in predicting the prices of houses in a rural city. It is fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the neighbourhood, since the neighbourhood does play a major role in attracting potential clients. Based on the above discussion, I conclude that this model cannot be used in the real-world setting."
